This app contains:

- An Onboarding screen (with a looped video in the background)

- A Transit section for choosing and "summoning" a vehicle (MapKit, route calculation)

- An Event Feed with custom transition animation (somewhat similar to the appstore one) to the detail view. 
Includes adding the chosen event to iOS calendar.

- A standard Chat (grouping by date and author)

- A Weather view (backdrops animated with CAEmitterLayer)

- An Entertainment section (tabs) - Music Player, Video Player and a collection view with variable cell sizes and a swipe-to-dismiss detail view
